too_much_change:

turn_on_or_off:
  - OK, turning the {} {} {}
  - I can definitely turn the {} {} {}
  - The {} {} shall be turned {} immediately
  - I shall turn the {} {} {} at once

# entity, entity_type, state
# Example: living room, light, on
already_state:
  - The {} {} is already {}
  - Why? the {} {} is already {}
  - But the {} {} is already {}
  - It's {3} now, but I guess I could try to turn it {3} again

# entity, entity type
# Example: living room, light

  - Where is the {} {}?

# name
# Example: Michael
greeting:
