# About

Jarvis is an app intended to work with [Snips Voice Assistant ](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki) which is a voice assistant that runs completely locally with no data ever sent to the cloud.

Jarvis works primarily with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) but can be run in a standalone mode as well.

Jarvis is configured to listen for "intents" that are sent from Snips over [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) and provide responses. Working with Home Assistant you can turn lights on or off, play a song or TV show, set reminders and anything else a smart home can do.

As a standalone app, Jarvis can tell you the weather, a joke, or even play a game with you.
